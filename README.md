#Dorian Kernytsky's Vim SETUP

##How to install

* git clone https://github.com/erifneerg/dotvim.git ~/dotvim
* sh dotvim/install
* vim

The install *should simlink the vimrc to it's proper place. After the it opens vim quickly to run vundle Bundle's installs and then quit.
 
Since I now have been using [Tim Pope's Vim sensiable][1], it would be a good idea to also setup the swp, undo and backup folders.

Enjoy
