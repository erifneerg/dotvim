#Dorian Kernytsky's Vim SETUP

##How to install

* git clone https://github.com/erifneerg/dotvim.git ~/.vim/
* ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc 
* git clone https://github.com/gmarik/vundle.git ~/.vim/bundle/vundle
* vim

Vundle will get all the bundles I use and can update as needed. You would only need to run :BundleInstall to get them.

Since I now have been using [Tim Pope's Vim sensiable][1], it would be a good idea to also setup the swp, undo and backup folders.

Enjoy
